sanhack
=======

Quick simulation code for sanitation in informal settlements. Not originally written by me; no license.

To use
======

1. Change the values as desired.
2. Save this file.
3. Run sanhack.py by opening it.
4. When the script completes, the command line window it opened will close. The files datafile.csv and statsfile.csv will now contain the results of the analysis.

Notes
=====

- For the first 4 parameters, the constants, there must only be one value.
- For the rest, there must be at least 2, separated by commas.
- Do not leave a space after any colon (":").
- This file must be in the same folder as sanhack.py.
- The files datafile.csv and statsfile.csv will be created in the same folder.
- If any file with the same name (e.g. datafile.csv) and location already existed, it will be replaced without prompt. Rename or move old analysis files to not lose them.
